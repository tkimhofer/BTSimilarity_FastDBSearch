# Fast spectral similarity clustering

This algorithm calculates the similarity between spectra based on binary trees, constructed using intensity weighted x-values.

Provided functions for calculating and visualising i) individual binary trees and ii) hierarchical agglomerative clusterings.

Algorithm adopted from DOI: 10.1016/S0003-2670(00)80840-5

The algorithm works for 1D NMR data as well as for chromatograms, e.g. SIC's or TIC's generated with LC-MS.
