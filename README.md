# Fast spectral similarity matching

This algorithm calculates the similarity between spectra based on binary tree similarity. Binary trees are constructed using intensity weighted x-values.

Functions provided are for calculating and visualising i) individual binary trees and ii) hierarchical aggolomerative clustering.
